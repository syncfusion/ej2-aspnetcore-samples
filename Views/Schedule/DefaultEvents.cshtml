            This sample illustrates the usage of different types of events such as normal, spanned and all-day. Here, the Schedule acts
            as a leave planner for an employee to plan his upcoming leaves as well as to keep track of his previously taken time-offs
            and leaves.

            Schedule requires only the <code>startTime</code> and <code>endTime</code> fields as mandatory to be mapped from datasource and provided with proper datetime values to display the normal
            events in it. The normal events can be categorized into 3 types based on its time range and all-day type.
